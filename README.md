This repository is for digital artifacts for the paper entitled "R+R: Evaluating Wireless Power Qi Charging Side Channels Using a Low-Cost Approach."

Descriptions of the files:  
* `hijacking_denial_of_charge_waveform_generator.py` custom Qi packet waveform that can be loaded onto a waveform generator and used as an injection payload for Qi charging disruption attacks.
* `Replication_WPT_Raw_Measurements_6_May_24.xlsx` eavesdropping data power measurements for replication experiments
* `Replication_WPT_Raw_Measurements_6_May_24_Corrected_Completed.xlsx` additional data added and some data (typos) corrected
